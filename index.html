    <p>My favorite beverage is called <i> fresco de ensalada</i>. It's a Salvadorian
    drink that incorporates chopped pineapple, apples, oranges, mango and lemon. The 
    recipe is simple, and you can always add your favorite fruits to make it your own. 
    There's even a small fruit salad at the bottom for you to eat once you finish the beverage. It's 
extremely refreshing and the perfect drink for the summer!</p>
